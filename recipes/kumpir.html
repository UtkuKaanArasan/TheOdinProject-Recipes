            <li>6-8 large potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup pickled gherkins (finely chopped))</li>

        <p>Method:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>After washing and drying the potatoes, first wrap them in baking paper, then aluminum foil and place
                them on the baking
                tray.</li>
            <li>We bake in an oven at 220 degrees for about 1.5 hours.</li>
            <li>Then we take it out of the oven and separate it from the papers and cook it uncovered for about half an
                hour. It may
                vary depending on the potato, check it and bake it again.</li>
